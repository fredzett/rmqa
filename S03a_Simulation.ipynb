    "Simulation is a very useful tool for statistics / data analysis and research in general. Some reasons for this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **solve probability problems**: use numerical approaches rather than analytical approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "- **calculate features of probability densities**: calculating features of probability densities involves integration. Instead we could draw a randomly from that density and just calculate the feature from the sampled data. \n",
    "\n",
    "    > Example:\n",
    "    > - what is the variance of a random variable that is described by a $\\text{Beta}(\\alpha=3,\\beta=6)$ distribution?\n",
    "    > - if we don't know the formula for this we can simply draw from this distribution (e.g. 1.000 times)\n",
    "    > - we then calculate the variance of our randomly sampled data\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **understand the assumed data generation process**: simulate data from a proposed model to get a feel for the data\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **evaluating estimators**: estimator $\\approx$ function of the data. How do we know if model is well specified and appropriate for our model? We can simulate a world, randomly draw data from that world and apply our function to that data. We can then check if we get the right estimator. \n",
    "\n",
    "    > Example:\n",
    "    > - create world: $y = 5 + 17 x + \\epsilon$, where: $\\epsilon = N(0,\\sigma^2)$\n",
    "    > - randomly draw data from world: $x = \\text{1.000 random numbers}$ $\\implies y $\n",
    "    > - estimate linear regression function and check if parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ can be recovered / are what we expect (i.e. if a linear regression model is well specified for our data)\n",
    "\n",
