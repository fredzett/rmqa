By using Bootstrap approach we can reach better solution even if we don't have lots of statistical information about the sample group. Because we multiply our population according to the sample group and calculate the standart deviation iteratively for each element.This process allows you to calculate standard errors, construct confidence intervals, and perform hypothesis testing for numerous types of sample statistics. Bootstrap methods are alternative approaches to traditional hypothesis testing and are notable for being easier to understand and valid for more conditions(https://statisticsbyjim.com/hypothesis-testing/bootstrapping/)\n",

    "1 Cross Validation is a technique which involves reserving a particular sample of a dataset on which you do not train the model. Later, you test your model on this sample before finalizing it(https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/05/improve-model-performance-cross-validation-in-python-r/). Cross validation is a checking mechanism that control whether our model is good or not. we use test and train groups which is chosen from our sample group.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 K-fold cross validation is implemented by derivating K numbered groups which have roughly equal to each other. ƒ±n K-fold validation The dataset is split into ‚Äòk‚Äô number of subsets, k-1 subsets then are used to train the model and the last subset is kept as a validation set to test the model. Then the score of the model on each fold is averaged to evaluate the performance of the model(https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/k-fold-cross-validation).\n",
    "\n",
    "3 A \n",
    "Advantage of k-fold cross validation relative to the validation set: The validation estimate of the test error rate can be highly variable, depending on precisely which observations are included in the training set and which observations are included in the validation set. Moreover, validation set error rate may tend to overestimate the test error rate for the model fit on the entire data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantage of k-fold cross validation relative to the validation set: Validation set approach is conceptually simple and easy to implement(https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/250194_57c5e6eb80c44b35be939cb233293972.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "3 B The LOOCV cross-validation approach is a special case of k-fold cross-validation in which k=n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantage of k-fold cross validation relative to LOOCV: LOOCV requires fitting the statistical learning method n times. This has the potential to be computationally expensive. Moreover, k-fold CV often gives more accurate estimates of the test error rate than does LOOCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantage of k-fold cross validation relative to LOOCV: If the main purpose bias reduction, LOOCV should be preffered to k-fold CV since it tends to has less bias.\n",
